# SQL-PROJECT
A SQL project solving real-world questions using joins, aggregates, and subqueries


🌱 What I Learned
This project helped me clear my SQL basics and made me realize how important it is to truly understand the concepts especially when it comes to joining multiple tables. Working through the questions gave me more confidence in writing real-world queries and understanding database structures.

A big thank you to Rishabh Mishra sir for providing such high-quality SQL projects and explanations — completely for free. 🙏

I'm still learning, and this is just the beginning!
